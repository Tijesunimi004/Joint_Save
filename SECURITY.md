3. **Affected Components:** The specific smart contracts, frontend pages, or API routes affected.
4. **Remediation Suggestion:** Any suggestions or proposed fixes, if available.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a responsible disclosure policy:
* **Fix Window:** We request a 90-day window from the time of the initial report to resolve the vulnerability before any public disclosure is made.
* **Coordinated Disclosure:** We will work with you to coordinate public disclosure of the vulnerability after a patch has been released.

## Known Limitations

Please note the following current limitations of the system:
* **No Formal Audit:** The smart contracts and frontend application have not undergone a formal security audit.
* **Testnet-Only Status:** The project is currently deployed on the Stellar Testnet only and should not be used with real mainnet assets.

## Audit Status
